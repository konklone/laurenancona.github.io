### Getting back into shape

After consciously choosing to focus solely on learning to code & related projects the past two years, since mid-July I’ve been in the gym again. I spent the previous 7 years working various performance-based weightlifting programs, but this time my goals are solely aesthetic. It's a very different experience than chasing PRs, and I'm really enjoying it.

Since I was _very_ detrained, I took the first 4-6 weeks just to focus on mobility and working to correct some posterior chain imbalances that have caused injury in the past. I'm not in a hurry, just enjoying the process. Lifting 3 days/week with programming by [one of my favorite coaches](https://bretcontreras.com/) + some flavor of yoga another 1-2.

### Spending more time IRL

I’ve been trying restore some balance. It’s tempting to spend 12-14 hours/day learning to program, and has served me well in terms of skill acquisition, but it was time to take care of my physical self. Reconnecting with friends, remembering how to be social.

### Making things with my hands

Started trying to work with cement as a medium to make [little lamps](https://www.instagram.com/laurenancona/), and learning new ways to [finish wood](https://www.instagram.com/p/BLfLds2hHaT/?taken-by=laurenancona).
