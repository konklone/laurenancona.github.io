####PHILLY POPE MAP
...was a labor of love. Preceeding the Pope's visit to Philadelphia in September 2015, a myriad of sources released geographic data about security measures affecting residents and attendees. Most information was only available in PDF format, and there was nowhere to see all of it at once. I started hand tracing boundaries, plotting points, and built a little wrapper application to allow users to select which information to display on the map. With the help of a few friends ([Thomas Fuchs](https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs) and [Mjumbe Poe](https://twitter.com/mjumbewu)), the final project was embedded in several area news outlets. The map accrued over **340,000** views by **51,000** unique users in the two week period prior and during the visit.
