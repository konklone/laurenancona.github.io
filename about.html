            <!-- <p>I studied music from age 8 (a relatively late start by professional standards) and finished a masters degree in instrumental conducting at 23. Then I promptly realized I didn't want it to be my <em>job</em>. After lucking into a yearlong, live-in internship in performing arts marketing at <a href="http://longwoodgardens.org">Longwood Gardens</a>, I spent 10 years in the nonprofit sector. Here, too, I was lucky: I'd started learning InDesign to save one employer the cost of paying an agency for ad resizes, and ended up working as an in-house print designer for 3.5 years at a time when new graduates of design school were struggling to find full-time work. If you're considering working in any industry where you'll need to make something and tell people about it, I cannot emphasize enough how useful it has been to be at least functionally proficient in Adobe Creative Suite and understand basic principles in graphic design, photography, and color theory.</p> -->
